This file is an ansible that i have created for practice purpose.
But this file have the yaml for lanching instances which are three in my file.
Also a yaml file for shuting down the instances.
I have used vault file for storing the creadentials of aws access and secret keys which are sensitive and not to be shown to others.
you can run this on your machine by installing ansible .
I have tried this aws by lanching a instance which is master node and install ansible,python and boto3 module in it.
And after writing the yaml file i ran them they are working perfect,
After that i push them into Github
